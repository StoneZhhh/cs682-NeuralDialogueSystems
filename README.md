# cs682-NeuralDialogueSystems

## Description
### Original idea
The idea is first published in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01008.pdf End-to-End Task-Completion Neural Dialogue Systems. The team implemented their version in https://github.com/MiuLab/TC-Bot.

### What we are planning to do
* re-implement the system
* Add some new features, typically some reinforcement learning tricks in some modules like System Action/Policy.

## Milestone
### Create the project
* decide the first version of project structure (psv1)
* fetch all the required data and redesign the data structure if needed
